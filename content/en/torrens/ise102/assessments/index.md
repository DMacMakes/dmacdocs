## Assessment 1: Exam

**Due: ** End of week 4
Testing your understanding of the ideas in programming, along with knowledge of C++ data types, structures, operators, evaluation and more. Reading the textbook, testing out _C++_ statements in a coding environment and working through _SoloLearn_ will make all the differenc in this one.


### Deliverable

An online, 90 minute exam you will complete through Blackboard. The exam will be available to start at any point from Sunday Week 3 until Sunday at the end of Week 4. 
  * The exam will be made available on the Friday of week 8 on the ISE102 _Assessment 2_ page on _Blackboard_.
  * Once started, you have to complete it within **90 minutes**.
  * You can **return** to the exam **during** those 90 minutes if your machine/internet goes down, but **not after**.
  * If a serious technical issue stops you from returning to it, please contact me. 
  * The uni will require a legitimate reason, so make sure that when you sit down you have time to complete it without interruption from family/friends/responsibilities.  

## Assessment 2: Slot Machine
**Due:** End of week 8

We'll make a text based slot machine using the `ise102_console` template. A _prompt and response_ game loop.
