## Visit resources first!

Before we can do any programming, you need to have the right software on hand. For those of you who haven't yet installed _Visual Studio_ and _Flowgorithm_ go do that.

## What Is Programming?

Programming evokes the idea of computers and code and binary. That's just the end of the process, the execution. 

Programming at its heart is something much more basic: **describing how a task is done**. If you want to bake a cake, then the recipe is a program. When you tell someone how to play a game you're programming them to play the game.

### It's Just Instructions

Giving instructions is something we learned at school and at home.

Maybe you haven't written a recipe, but **you've given someone instructions**. Maybe you asked your dad to drive you to your friend's house. When you told him the time to leave and your friend's address, you could say you did some _Parental Programming_.

{{% alert title="Parental Programming" %}}
My 3 year old son is an expert programmer of parents. This helps when he wants warm milk but can't instruct the microwave to do it. What he can do is **instruct an adult** to prepare the milk:

```
// Here is the program Harvey speaks to his mum:
"Mum, I want a bottle please. Can you make it better?"
```
{{% /alert %}}

### Interpreting the program

Mum, like any good computer, has an _**instruction set**_. Each instruction encoded in Harvey's program translates predictably an action she can perform:

```
Instruction: "Mum"
Action: Begin accepting program input

Instruction: "I want a bottle please"
Action: Place 250ml of milk in a baby bottle

Instruction: "Can you make it better?"
Action: Warm it for 40 seconds in the microwave.
```

## Requirements for Programming

What, then, did we need for programming to work?

**You need:**
1. A **subject**
   - A human or a computer that you will you program to do the work
1. A list of **instructions**
   - Steps which, performed correctly, will lead to a completed task.
1. A common spoken/written **language** 
  - An agreed _grammar_: how the words are ordered to have meaning.
  - An agreed _instruction set_: keywords which trigger actions in your subject.
1. An agreed **place/context** for the work:
   - Dad (subject) needs a car and the roads (context) to do the work
   - Mum  _Windows Command Prompt_)

## Storage

Memory boxes. Memory that can have variable contents. Instead of calling them variable memory boxes, call them simply **variables**.

## Summary

* Install the required software
* Programming is just a list of instructions to complete a task
* A computer/person is mostly input/storage/processing/output
* You already program things, you're just learning how to apply it to a computer.

* To program you need:
  - Language
  - A subject you will program with that language (human, computer)
  - A list of instructions (in an agreed grammar, from an agreed upon instruction set)
  - An agreed place the subject can do the work (car, kitchen, _Windows Command Prompt_)

* We made a simple game, Knights Journey, with help from our 4 basic categories (input, storage etc)
  - Once, in _Visual Studio_ with _C++_, for the _Windows Command Prompt/Console_
* We made it again visually, in _Flowgorithm_.


* Syntax, grammar, whitespace (week 2?)
