## Download And Install ZBrush

* Installers for windows, mac on one drive.
* At home: 30 day trial, Rent month by month, Buy outright.
* Otherwise, lab machines.

## Digital Sculpting?

* What is sculpture (some classical, modern pics)
* Isn't Maya 3D sculpting?
  * Technically, sure
  * In practise it's focussed on points and edges and faces It uses transforms.
  * Generally useful in the < 100K polygons space
(One pic of Maya with smoothed object, maybe joystick)

* ZBrush 
  * Focussed on smooshing and building and carving surfaces
  * Provides tools  a sculptor would recognise
  * Tries to automate the polygon part away
  * Happily works with millions of "polygons" by using a different paradigm internally

(pics of brushes, scultped objects, wireframes)

### From Film To Games

Many wrinkly monsters, festy zombies and gnarled trees in film have been created with ZBrush.

* When it was first made, games couldn't integrate ZB level 3D except in cinematics
* Won Oscar for contribution to film effects
* GPU accelerated normal maps came along, you could now steal the details from those high res models and approximate them on game models.
* Unreal engine (and whatever doom 3 was on??)
  
**PICS OF DOOM 3, OTHER EARLY NORMAL MAP TITLES**

**PIC OF high res model, low res model, then normal mapped result. Overwatch?**

## Intro to ZBrush

Using ZBrush on the uni computers or your own.

* Open a **STARTING SCENE I PROVIDE**
* Import the settings I give out (basic right click nav, not saving undo)
* Navigate
* Save settings.

First marks:
* Standard brush. Dam standard.
* Move brush

Adding mass:

* Smooth brush

More cleaning:
* Trim Dynamic, HPolish
* Pinch

* Exiting edit mode by mistake (T)
* Getting back into it.

## Assessment 2: Character Sculpt

* What to make
* Milestones/deliverables
* Baldy character head
* Or keycap/artisan

### Today, Pick Concept

Offer selection.
If your own character's head is very well realised in multiple angles, you can make them (without hair)

j## My Notes

## PBR rendering
Our goal is to get the model/s Rendered nicely with PBR textures.

Painter is an option if time is short. 

Ideally we go out to a game engine:
1. Pick a renderer: Unreal? Unity?
1. Export our model from Maya/Painter into a format our renderer accepts
2. Import into our renderer, apply lighting and settings.
3. Beautify
4. Capture screenshots for Journal/Forum.
