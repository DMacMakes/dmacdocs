  Turning 3D art into playable game assets means exporting to a real time **game engine**. Today we'll learn how to move our models from Maya and Painter into Unreal/Unity. From there you can light and screenshot them for your **final deliverables** of Assessment 1.

## Substance

* link coming for recent UI tute

### Import

### Applying a basic material

* Not impressive at first
* One featureless texture all over the object

### Baking

Generate all the high res model data we need.

* normals tangent/world space
* AO
* Color ID/Clown map
* thickness 
* world space normals
* curves etc

## Texturing

Mask by color selection.

## Presenting Our Results

Look development: real time rendering.

Talk about what look development is and how it's done. First renders are from Painter, Toolbag perhaps, and roughs are pushed out to engine.

Provide materials for students to learn the real meat at home.

### Activities
1. Synchronous Class Activity 4:  Shading and Lighting Workflows
2. Game Studio Activity 3: Implementing Shading Workflows
3. Blog Activity: Final Hard Surface Sharing
4. Personal Portfolio Activity 1

### Covered in Module:

- Shading Workflows
- Look Development Workflows
- Showcasing Techniques
(we covered Unity PBR basics at end of ACR103 üëç)

### M4 Assessment progression:
* Shade, light, showcase object w realtime rendering.
* Complete A1
* Share final model and render in blog
* Explore what others have done.

## My Notes

## PBR rendering
Our goal is to get the model/s Rendered nicely with PBR textures.

Painter is an option if time is short. 

Ideally we go out to a game engine:
1. Pick a renderer: Unreal? Unity?
1. Export our model from Maya/Painter into a format our renderer accepts
2. Import into our renderer, apply lighting and settings.
3. Beautify
4. Capture screenshots for Journal/Forum.
