  Turning 3D art into playable game assets means exporting to a real time **game engine**. Today we'll learn how to move our models from Maya and Painter into Unreal/Unity. From there you can light and screenshot them for your **final deliverables** of Assessment 1.

## My Notes

## PBR rendering
Our goal is to get the model/s out of Maya and Painter and into a real-time rendered game environment.

What needs to happen?
1. Pick a renderer: we'll use Unreal? Unity? Toolbag?
1. Export our model from Maya/Painter into a format our renderer accepts
2. Import into our renderer, apply lighting and settings.
3. Beautify
4. Capture screenshots for Journal/Forum.
