## Digital Sculpting?

* What is sculpture (some classical, modern pics)
* Isn't Maya 3D sculpting?
  * Technically, sure
  * In practise it's focussed on points and edges and faces It uses transforms.
  * Generally useful in the < 100K polygons space
(One pic of Maya with smoothed object, maybe joystick)

* ZBrush 
  * Focussed on smooshing and building and carving surfaces
  * Provides tools  a sculptor would recognise
  * Tries to automate the polygon part away
  * Happily works with millions of "polygons" by using a different paradigm internally

(pics of brushes, scultped objects, wireframes)

### From Film To Games

Many wrinkly monsters, festy zombies and gnarled trees in film have been created with ZBrush.

* When it was first made, games couldn't integrate ZB level 3D except in cinematics
* Won Oscar for contribution to film effects
* GPU accelerated normal maps came along, you could now steal the details from those high res models and approximate them on game models.
* Unreal engine (and whatever doom 3 was on??)
  
**PICS of wrinkly movie monsters, pref really zbrushed.**
  
**PICS OF DOOM 3, OTHER EARLY NORMAL MAP TITLES**

**PIC OF high res model, low res model, then normal mapped result. Overwatch?**

## Intro to ZBrush

Using ZBrush on the uni computers or your own.

* Open a **STARTING SCENE I PROVIDE**
* Import the settings I give out (basic right click nav, not saving undo)
* Navigate
  - Right drag tumble
  - Right drag shift snap top/front/left etc
  - alt-right-drag pan
  - ctrl-right-drag zoom
* Save settings.

First marks:
* On provided sphere
* Standard brush. Dam standard.
* Move brush

Adding mass:
* Still on sphere
* Clay buildup, Inflate
* Smooth brush
* Snake hook elastic?

More cleaning, subtools:
* Trim Dynamic, HPolish
* Pinch (on dam standard)
* Switch to cube subtool, solo.
* trim dynamic, hpolish the corners
* Now smooth, pinch

Pixelation?? Subdivision up down

## Free play

Play around and make something. Ideas:

* Mad ballz
* Heart
* Cake
* Floaty droid (maybe light sabre practise thing from star wars?)
* Muscley torso.
  
## More Basics

Auto masking:
* switch to skinny object
* Show how sculpting damages back faces
* Backface auto masking
* Inflate brush (without backface mask)

Different Materials:
* how materials affect our perception: detail pops when shiney, not matte.
* Stylised materials a little
* Colours vs material

Getting Out Of Trouble
* things aren't moving - Lost edit mode (hit t)
* 

Watch out:
* Exiting edit mode by mistake (T)
* Getting back into it.

## Assessment 2: Character Sculpt

* What to make
* Milestones/deliverables
* Baldy character head
* Or keycap/artisan

### Today, Pick Concept

Offer selection.
If your own character's head is very well realised in multiple angles, you can make them (without hair)
