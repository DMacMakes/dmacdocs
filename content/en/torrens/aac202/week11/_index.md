  Turning parts into structures.
---

## Detailing: Fixes/improvements to parts we did

## Extending:
Duplicating and modifying to save time. Hiding the duplication.

* Methods for duplication
* Splitting to sep subtools, using solo/xray mode (performance upside too)

## Adding On
You've added the props. Now add your own bits!
Arrow in the wood? Bullet chunk out of stone?

### Making Add Ons
1. Model and import from Maya
2. GoZ
2. Model direct in Zbrush with primitives and init

## Homework
Build out the asset using the parts you made last week.
Differentiate them without losing your silhouette.
