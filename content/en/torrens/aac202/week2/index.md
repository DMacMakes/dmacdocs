## Assess our progress on prop

### Paintovers

Modelling is slow and destructive, not great for quick iterations.

**Screenshots from Orb's artstation, show how he detailed his library assets.**

Painting:  
  1. Take greyscale screenshots
  2. Do a rough linework layer if needed
  3. Paint basic light planes with 3 or 4 tones to create your new form
  4. Refine, try multiple options
  5. Assess what needs maya modelling, what can be done with stamping/normal maps (embossed text, panels)
  5. Implement modelling changes in maya
  6. Next week we'll look at stamping.

**SCREENSHOTS OF STAMPING TOO**

Can also be used to plan things we'll add with stamping.

## UV Maps

We'll need UV maps for painting and baking.

### Review UV unwrap.
Discuss how it's different (if it is) for higher res.

### Extra uv unwrap tips.
