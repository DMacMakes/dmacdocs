## Assessment 2

Marking is 90% done, will be up this afternoon. The level of effort was high enough that everyone who submitted got at least a credit, so don't stress.

## Refining

* Anything that's too repetitive?
* Silhouette too broken up, too organic?
* Last bits of story?

## Finishing

Rendering with Orb's setup.
Save this [step-by-step tutorial by Orb/Michael Vicente](https://laureateaus-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/daniel_mcgillick_laureate_edu_au/Ea6azVT_8EpKjeq_YFqng-ABfNCHg1-LgWcGkiTcwCYEWA?e=meF9tb), where he explains and demonstrates his rendering process in ZBrush.

If you take the time to follow it, put in the work, having your renders look this good and demonstrating your effort will be worth solid marks, taking you up into distinction territory.

Don't make your file overly heavy! You should be able to get all your necessary stone details in 250K-350K points each, for example, less on the boring stones. Overly heavy means you are trying to work with the scene and it's uber slow, maybe rendering takes forever etc.

## Decimation And Topo Demo

For learning's sake.
