## M4 Intro BLACKBOARD

Look development: real time rendering.

Talk about what look development is and how it's done. Provide materials for students to learn the real meat at home.

### Activities
1. Synchronous Class Activity 4:  Shading and Lighting Workflows
2. Game Studio Activity 3: Implementing Shading Workflows
3. Blog Activity: Final Hard Surface Sharing
4. Personal Portfolio Activity 1

### Covered in Module:

- Shading Workflows
- Look Development Workflows
- Showcasing Techniques
(Luckily I taught Unity PBR basics at end of ACR103)

### M4 Assessment progression:
* Shade, light, showcase object w realtime rendering.
* Complete A1
* Share final model and render in blog
* Explore what others have done.

## M4 Learning Resources BLACKBOARD

Unity 5 (?? this is outdated, enlighten is deprecated) lighting. **Replace with up to date tute**

## FROM MODULE 1 BLACKBOARD 

* 3D Creation pipelines, strategies

Students follow the learning resources and do the activities:
1. Class Activity: 3d asset pipeline activity.
1. Game studio(?) activity: design breakdown
1. Assessment progress: Design Sheet

Covers: 
1. Design/conceptualization
2. importance observation, planning, strategy in 3d asset creation (talk reference?)
3. Advanced blocking/base meshes

Laureate visual roadmap of assessment 1:
1. Design or conceptualize a 3D object based on scope provided (i'll specify a type of object)
2. Share your work in progress in week 2 forum
3. present your textured and lit model.

Learning  Material:
From [Module 1 blackboard](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_8566861_1&course_id=_83852_1&mode=reset)
1. Flipped normals on observation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpd1AKwJLUg&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIrBAzc6Schs7WXdV13thGU6
2. Lynda What is concept art (**CHECK this works for students with Trent**): https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_8566861_1&course_id=_83852_1&mode=reset
3. Principles 3d modeling in games **BROKEN?!** http://www.indiegamedeveloper.tv/principles-of-3d-game-art-modelling/
4. Concept art is dead talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYbYvImd7Bw

Seems it's all about planning/strategising your advanced asset, designing and concepting - but doesn't teach high res modelling techniques first. very very weird?

The object the students are to "break down" and consider modeling strategies for in class is a clear subdiv model:

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eqOLgEHLWf4/Uua2ytK_kyI/AAAAAAAAAKM/bfz8uI6wjus/s1600/HS_w3_HP.jpg

specs: 
    Details - one mesh only, with no UVs or textures required
    Topology â€“ all quads, and not more than 2000 polys
    Your facilitator might indicate additional expectations
    The facilitator may ask faster students to share their workflow with other students.

Again this is a real muddle of design and execution. Hard to imagine fitting both in.

Focus on what is subdiv modeling, what is it suited to. Then show example concepts of objects suited to this approach. Their strategising will have to come down to starting shapes and lines, but really they need a few hours of video watching to do that. The model shown is tricky to subdiv model, and would actually be delivered as normal mapped. Odd.

But we can talk subdiv modeling: working with quads, making holes, going from one cylinder to one sticking out (yikes) show some techniques, then move on to how to doing a drawover together.

Add my links to subdiv modelling.

### Assessment

Assessment 1 roadmap has a picture of normal mapped (from v high res), pbr textured high res models in a game engine with post processing 
1. Says 1-3 game props. week 4 showcase.
2. 2000 triangles and 1 texture per prop (**query**: Need at least albedo/smooth/metalness for PBR)
3. Mentions optional lods

A1 workflow mentions sculpting and "maybe" retopo, also mentions baking.. but only one texture, so can't use bake unless just compositing AO??

### Modeling and UV
Appears to teach uving in the class maybe and talk about height and normal maps. High poly modeling appears to come down to just using more polygons.
