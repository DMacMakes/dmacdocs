## Assessment 1: High Detail Props
For Assessment 1 you'll create a **high detail, normal mapped** prop using **techniques shown in class** and developed at home. These will include subdivision modeling, normal mapping and PBR textures.

* [Assessment 1 Submission Page on Blackboard](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_8566877_1&course_id=_83852_1)
* [Assessment 1 Brief](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-8566919-dt-content-rid-18209834_1/xid-18209834_1) on Blackboard (PDF)

You'll be **targeting an environment concept** provided in the Week 1 notes, and **working to a style** provided there:
[Assessment 1 in Week 1 Notes](../week1/#assessment-1-high-detail-props)

There are deliverables for **week 1**, **week 2** and **week 4**.

### Week 1 Deliverables
**Select** an object from the environment concept **or design** a fitting prop of your own. This will be posted to the subject **forums**. Concept, style reference and instructions are in the week 1 notes:

[Week 1 Deliverables in the notes](../week1/#deliverable-this-week)

### Week 2 Deliverables
Production plan, modelling progress and more written responses:

[Week 2 Deliverables in the notes](../week2/#deliverable-this-week) (coming soon)

### Week 4 Deliverables
Your final deliverable will be screenshots and an export from Substance Painter. More details:

## Assessment 2: High Poly Character

The brief for the assessment delves into things we won't actually be covering here or fitting in. That said, we'll still be delivering a sculpted character in rendered images (and working zpr file), and I'll go through how the marking rubric is still relevant.

### The Task

Select one of the heads you _didn't_ already sculpt. Using what you've learned in your first attempt and in third ZBrush class (polypaint, merging, dynamesh), sculpt a high quality, polypainted 3D model of the character.

### Deliverables And Submission

1. Your final **ZPR file**
2. **Renders** (`shift+r`) of your character from multiple angles.
   * **Side, front, back** (with perspective enabled: press `p`)
   * A **beauty render 3/4 angle** to show off the character 
   * Don't have the character tiny in the middle of the canvas. Move zbrush to your largest screen and have the character take up most of the canvas.

The **beauty render** should be rendered to passes and taken into Photoshop or a similar image editor and polished up. 

* **How to render passes**: [week9 notes \> render passes](../week9/#render-passes)
  * If you have Photoshop you can use the Zbrush To Photoshop CC plugin to select and export them
  * Otherwise use the RenderPass buttons to export individual passes.
* Some **polishing** possibilities:
  * Cropping to a nice composition
  * Warming/cooling shadows, maybe improving the contrast
  * Adding rim light  
  * Adding gloss/specular hilight/shine to some elements
  * painting in eyelashes and eyebrows that you didn't have geometry for
    
{{< alert title="Submitting Your Files" color= "primary" >}}
1. Put your beauty render, other screenshots and your final ZPR file in a folder.
2. **Rename that folder** `firstnameLastname_zbrushCharacter_AAC202`, zip it and and submit it on the **Blackboard** Assessment 2 page.

## Assessment 3: High Poly Environments

Individual/group

First, the [view the pdf brief on Blackboard](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_8566879_1&course_id=_83852_1)

Enough starting material for 2-3 students given in one class (we have 2.5 weeks left) is challenging.

Wood person, rock person and metal person could be a start.

Stone wall, metal fence and wooden gate? Dungeon/graveyard pack?
