## Assessment 1: High Detail Props
For Assessment 1 you'll create a **high detail, normal mapped** prop using **techniques shown in class** and developed at home. These will include subdivision modeling, normal mapping and PBR textures.

* [Assessment 1 Submission Page on Blackboard](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_8989774_1&course_id=_89547_1)
* [Assessment 1 Brief](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-8989819-dt-content-rid-18209834_1/xid-18209834_1) on Blackboard (PDF)

You'll be **targeting an environment concept** provided in the Week 1 notes, and **working to a style** provided there:
[Assessment 1 in Week 1 Notes](../week1/#assessment-1-high-detail-props)

There are deliverables for **week 1**, **week 2** and **week 4**.

### Week 1: Concept, style, tutorials
**Select** a prop to model, share your choice. Choose style reference, watch and take notes on subdivision modeling videos. Follow the link for details and to submit your work:

### Week 2: Assessing, drafting, modelling.

**Assessing** style, **drafting** your topology, **modelling** your prop. You'll share the results with your classmates and offer eachother **feedback**. Follow the link to the discussion forum for details and to submit your work:

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary mr-3 mb-4" href="https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/discussionboard/do/message?action=list_messages&course_id=_94273_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&conf_id=_170634_1&forum_id=_902733_1&message_id=_2278364_1" target="_blank">A1 Week 2 Submissions<i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right ml-2"></i></a>

<!--

#### Work to do  

Copy the concept image into a new file and:  
  1. Add notes/drawings to the concept of the prop to **plan style**
  2. Add notes and draw over a duplicate of the concept to plan your **topology**
 
**Model** your prop :
  1. **Block in** the model (in pieces) with:   
      * dynamic silhouettes considered   
      * topology that won't cause problems for subdivisions  
  2. Then use edges and creases to create **bevelling/rounding** and smooth shapes.  
  3. **Refine** your model, add details.
  
#### Process images due TUESDAY by end of day:

1. Add a reply to [the discussion here](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/discussionboard/do/message?action=list_messages&course_id=_89547_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&conf_id=_152757_1&forum_id=_866554_1&message_id=_2100660_1), containing:
    * **1 image** of the concept with your notes/drawings planning style and topology solutions
    * **2+ images** of your model with smooth preview off (press `1`)
    * **2+ images** of your model with smooth preview on (press `3`)
    * **1 image** of your model with all parts selected and the **outliner** visible (to see your objects and their naming)
  
{{< alert title="Image qualities" color= "secondary" >}}
> All images should have plenty of resolution (at least **1024x768** and preferably higher). Deliver as 24bit PNGs or JPGs of 85% or greater quality.  
> 
> Screenshots of the model in Maya:
> * Have shaded view, wireframe on shaded and ambient occlusion enabled
> * Use camera angles that show off the model and also the geometry you used to achieve the right smoothed forms.
> * Are from a viewport that is large and with the model zoomed large within it, producing clear images. No tiny thumbnails.
{{< /alert >}}
  
#### Comments due WEDNESDAY, before class (3pm)
Comment on two other students work, offering well thought out feedback:
1. In matching capturing the concepts and matching the 3D style what did they do well?
2. What changes/additions might improve the model?

-->

### Week 4 submission details

**Delivery:**
1. Create a folder for your final deliverables. Call it `Firstname_Lastname_A1Final_AAC202`
2. Copy into the folder:
    * Your **final maya scene file**. In your scenes folder, find your latest `.ma` or `.mb` file. This contains your final `_game` and `_subd` meshes.
    * The **renders and screenshots** described below
3. Zip up the folder and submit the `Firstname_Lastname_A1Final_AAC202.zip` file to the [assessment 1 page on blackboard](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_8989774_1&course_id=_89547_1)

## Assessment 2: High Poly Character

The brief for the assessment delves into things we won't actually be covering here or fitting in. That said, we'll still be delivering a sculpted character in rendered images (and working zpr file), and I'll go through how the marking rubric is still relevant.

[PDF Brief](https://learn-ap-southeast-2-prod-fleet01-xythos.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/5c07149a959f5/4656692?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27AAC202%2520Assessment%25202_2018.pdf&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20200409T012856Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=21600&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIW5OVFIUOTV36DNA%2F20200409%2Fap-southeast-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=d84dec4be2e49818e35e4c680ae3f56a7a59bdd37e702a0eacd930e2f7ace1f8) on Blackboard

### The Task

Select one of the heads you _didn't_ already sculpt. Using what you've learned in your first attempt and in third ZBrush class (polypaint, merging, dynamesh), sculpt a high quality, polypainted 3D model of the character.

### Deliverables And Submission

1. Your final **ZPR file**
2. **Renders** (`shift+r`) of your character from multiple angles, with polypaint on.
   * **Side, front, back** (with perspective enabled: press `p`)
   * A **beauty render 3/4 angle** to show off the character. You can polish it a bit in photoshop.
   * Don't have the character tiny in the middle of the canvas. Move zbrush to your largest screen and have the character take up most of the canvas.
3. Screenshots of your character in _Substance Painter_
   * A few shots to show off the quality of the Bake
   * A shot with wireframe enabled to show the decimated mesh.

Some **polishing** possibilities:
  * Cropping to a nice composition
  * Warming/cooling shadows, maybe improving the contrast
  * Adding rim light  
  * Adding gloss/specular hilight/shine to some elements
  * painting in eyelashes and eyebrows that you didn't have geometry for
    

{{< alert title="Submitting Your Files" color= "primary" >}}
1. Put your beauty render, other ZB screenshots, Painter screenshots and your final ZPR file in a folder.
2. **Rename that folder** `AAC202_A2_Lastname_Firstname`, zip it and, if it's not too big, submit it on the **Blackboard** Assessment 2 page.
3. If that file is very large (>100MB) use the Torrens LFS to upload it. If you don't know how to use the LFS, upload it to cloud storage like drive/dropbox/onedrive and provide a link when you submit.

{{< alert title="Submitting Your Files" color= "primary" >}}
1. Put your beauty render, other ZB screenshots (described below) and your final ZPR file in a folder.
2. **Rename that folder** `AAC202_A3_Lastname_Firstname`, zip it up.
3. Use the Torrens LFS to upload it (instructions at bottom of page).
4. Submit the link on the Blackboard submission page.
{{< /alert >}}

**Images**
1. Using orb's method of rendering and then compositing in photoshop, **produce one final beauty render** of your model from what you feel is the best angle to show it off. Make sure it's not tiny on screen, we need resolution.
   - I'd first investigate if the angle in the concept art is best, it may well be. 
   - Export the image from photoshop (File - Export - Export As) as a 24 bit png.
2. Take some screenshots of renders done within zbrush (shift-r) as well, showing off your work from various angles/zoom. **No more than 4** screenshots.

## Torrens Large File System

{{< alert title="Linking a zip file from _LFS_" color= "primary" >}}
The **_Torrens Large File Submission_** cloud drive is where you upload your large assessment files. 

1. Follow the **video instructions** on the front page (scroll down) to upload your file into the `Trimester2 / ACR103 folder`  
2. generate the **_share_ link** you need for your Blackboard submission.
