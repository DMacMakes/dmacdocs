## Choices

### Develop This Guy
My art director and first tier clients wanted more ear guy, I did variations on that. Went through colours, bigger toothier face etc.

Art director passed on to clients. Clients unsure, wanted to see cuter.

Cuter, turnaround, more clarity around limbs including slick footwear.

### Modify And Test

Also how he'd look teaching

{{< imgcard earguy_teaching Link "earguy_teaching.png">}}
The character levelled up through learning, so how does he look teaching/learning?

### Recutify

More rounder, egg/minion like, softer

Earhands more cuter: rounder, more like a minion, more eggy, softer.

## Hang On

If I recall correctly, this is when the client's client had reservations and wanted to bring back a few other options. That might sound like an eye rolling moment, but not if you liked your options and enjoy designing characters! 

Client was unsure and requested a survey image they could show to a small focus group of regular people

People went for the pikachuish one. Could be appeal, could be recognition, could be biased by the dancing vs static poses, no way to know. 

{{< alert title="There Is No Why" color= "warning" >}}
If you try to know why a final, single choice was made, you'll never relax into the job. People don't fully know why they love things. What they do know generally, is a polished, **fundamentally solid** character design vs a janky one. I know **each of the variations had fans** in our office, all for their own reasons, I imagine the focus group was the same. Given the requirement to choose one, each chose, and that's that. 

Just **aim for valid, solid options**. You always have home hours to make/refine the stuff you personally prefer.
