Hopefully I can help with that today.

## Last Weeks Homework: Scene Concept

## Environment Styles 2D and 3D

Reference linked from my Pinterest.

### Style Reference

Critical! Photo reference tells us what things look like. We're not making real things though, we're making game art. Since none of us (including me) have a super developed, world famous style, we need to show the style we'll be working in.

## A Folio?

Some of those images linked to Behance Pages and Artstation, and were parts of a set.
