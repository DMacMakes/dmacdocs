## What Have I/You Forgotten?

There's a fair bit to remember when it comes to submitting your work. Here's a list of things to look for, and to ask me about if I've left them out.
  * Final due dates and smaller deliverable due dates
  * Tasks - what are we making?
  * Deliverables - what outputs are needed, in what structure?
  * Specific file formats and requirements:
    * PSD with layers or flat PNG? What version of the program do I export from? 
    * How do I deliver large files? How do I reduce file size?
  * Etc
