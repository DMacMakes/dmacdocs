Rough summary: It's a journal you will share only with me, and it contains images you made for the weekly exercises, along with your reflections on how you used/benefited from class theory in their creation. By the end of the Trimester you'll have at least 12 entries.

**Due:** 11:55PM, Sunday at end of Week 12 (module 6.2). 
**Weighting:** 30%.

### Weekly Deliverables

For weekly Assessment 3 deliverablys check the **week's notes** (left nav, or top of page nav button on mobile).

## Assessment 1: Character Portfolio

**Due Date:** 11:55pm, Wednesday, **April 1**. (revised due to campus closure)

First, read the brief carefully:

[Brief on Blackboard](https://learn-ap-southeast-2-prod-fleet01-xythos.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/5c07149a959f5/15620432?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27ACR101%2520Assessment%25201.2019113.pdf&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20200317T031337Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=21600&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIW5OVFIUOTV36DNA%2F20200317%2Fap-southeast-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=c5aaccaf0afc2a3bd67edab1aae8b46fd04f124aef5e70a995bd6001318eb738)

### Deliverables

12 pages, as per the brief, with 5 or so for being reference.

Handy specs:
* Jpg (90% quality) or png
* Largest dimension around 2500-3000px (width for landscape, height for portrait).
* Named 1_content_of_page.jpg, 2_content_of_page.jpg and so on.
  * eg: 1_backstory_and_poses.jpg, 2_first_sketches_and_reference.jpg
* A little text to explain what you're showing.
* Credit any artist's work below/on each image. (no need to credit random photographs of swords etc)

Zip all 12 (or more) page files into one archive and submit it via Blackboard. Name it as follows:

`firstName_lastName_character_folio_acr101.zip`.

#### Templates

Here are some PSD files you can use as page templates. 

1. [Landscape, 4K PSD](character_folio_template_landscape.psd)
2. [Portrait, almost 4K PSD](character_folio_template_portrait.psd).

Each is just a blank white page with enough resolution to support your images. If you use these templates **you can export a JPG or PNG at 75% scale** for your final submission and have enough resolution.

Because some people were unsure about visualising the whole 12 pages and laying it out, there's layer in the psds with **12 grey thumbnail pages** matching the ratio of the template. Might come in handy for planning.

### Filling 12 Pages

Some ideas:
* silhouettes of various design ideas
* more silhouettes exploring your pick of those early ones
* drawings of character from silhouettes, exploring colour palettes
* Realistic vs styled
* character posed in common scenarios theyâ€™d likely be in (wolverine yelling at kids, pikachu shorting out his switch)
* turnaround
* show the exploration of faces/hairstyles/outfits along the way

## What Have I/You Forgotten?

There's a fair bit to remember when it comes to submitting your work. Here's a list of things to look for, and to ask me about if I've left them out.
  * Final due dates and smaller deliverable due dates
  * Tasks - what are we making?
  * Deliverables - what outputs are needed, in what structure?
  * Specific file formats and requirements:
    * PSD with layers or flat PNG? What version of the program do I export from? 
    * How do I deliver large files? How do I reduce file size?
  * Etc
