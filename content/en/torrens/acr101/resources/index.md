## Pinterest Board

Make sure you head over and join [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com.au/). It's incredibly helpful, for building up reference, finding inspiration and organising/remembering your influences in a less fuzzy way.

Here are some useful boards I've built up over the years:

## Software

You'll need a few software packages on your pc, whether it's your home pc for assesments or a laptop you're bringing to class.

### Image editor

Photoshop is preferred and will be demonstrated in class. Krita is a quality, free alternative.

### Pureref

Opening your reference and concepts in Pureref throughout a project is key to good finished work.

You can choose **installer or portable** from the dropdowns on the download page. A portable version just unzips to a folder.
