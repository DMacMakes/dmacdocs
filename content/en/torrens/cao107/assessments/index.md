# Assessment 1: Labs

Optimising matrix math performance via:
  - memory access / cache hits
  - threading
  - thread pooling

Sample, inefficient algorithm provided, though if you don't know the theory it's meaningless single-letter-variable gibberish.

**3 Deliverables:** Weeks **2, 3, 4.**

# Assessment 2: Multi threaded loader

Load, in parallel, and then display/play multiple images and sounds. Display the time taken to load and display/begin playing the files.

Base given out: windows app with _File_ and _Exit_. _File - Load Image_ and _File - Load Sound_ each open a file browser. Uses Visual Studio gui bits, `rc` resource file.

# Assessment 3: Cuda + Cpu threads Mandelbrot

Look for available resources: Cpu cores and Cuda hardware on a capable Nvidia Gpu. Create an interactive image of the mandelbrot set using these resources.

Split work appropriately
