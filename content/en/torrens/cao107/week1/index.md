## Blackboard

* 1 module per week
  - Modules contain slides, code, **requirements for reading and viewing** each week
* Assessment briefs and submission
  - 3 assessments, **week 4, week 7, week 11**
* Discussion forums
  - Places we'll post intros, some exercise results

## Activities
We'll do one activity in class this week, and the other in homework.

### Hello part 1: written introductions

- write a paragraph introducing your self

## Me, what I've done

Danny. I like dogs and keyboards, character art and rockclimbing. I played a lot of games in the 90s and 20teens. I used to do those more, now I hang out a lot with a four year old so I'm pretty cool.

Coder and artist in industry:
- Coded a lot of interactive work for brands: experience websites, interactive posters, games in banner ads
  - Augmented reality, webcam motion sensing, 3d engines in flash, old school 2d driving games, interactive video, wayfinding etc
  - Nissan, Sony, eBay, New Line Cinema, Roadshow, St.George etc
- Prop art and then character art for 2D and 3D games.
  - Photoshop, Maya, Zbrush, Substance Painter. High res, low res, pixel art.
  - Torus Games, Wayforward (USA), Halbrick, Blowfish.
  - GBA, PS4, XBone, Switch, PC, iOS/Android
- Systems guy
  - Building/maintaining/networking high performance computing (HPC) systems for film/tv effects and editingin early 2000s: SGI, Mac, PC. Demoing and training Houdini, Avid products.

Computer Scientist:
- B Computing Science UTS

Teaching:
  - Last few years here at Torrens.

## You guys, and things you've done

Maths 101, Algorithms and data structures, ise102 (C++).
- Welcome back if you're my ise102 peoples

## What will we learn?
How to write very high performance code that will make the most of the computer power you have available.  This won't have a lot to do with understanding C++ better, though that'll be needed too. We'll learn more about how the hardware itself works, what's super slow (by electronic standards), and basically what exploits we need to know to outperform other programmers' code.

Programming is a game. 

Think of programming as a game. Writing code is like inputting keypresses, mouse movements, d-pad and analogue stick movements. The hardware you're running on, whether it's PS4 or iOS or an intel PC, is like the game engine. You can only get so far practising the game based on what it gives you: you have to research way the game's been implemented to get to top tier.

Any extra info you can get about what's under the hood can be used to give yourself an advantage. In Ultra SF4 it was knowing the frame data of each individual attack, the hitboxes and hurt boxes, the order the input buffer handled things when you pressed 3 buttons at once. In Overwatch, you want to know the damage per second once reload times are included, the headshot multipliers, how armour decreases damage from beam weapons (tip: heavily because they are a sequence of small hits) vs how armour impacts single or spread projectile weapons. Then there's the nitty gritty of what animations you can or can't cancel to land combos, what the real head hitbox sizes are vs the models etc.

### Specifically, what will we learn?

This is taken from the Subject Planner on the [CAO107 Blackboard landing page](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_7966066_1&course_id=_76813_1). 

{{< imgcard modules_all Link "modules_all.png" >}}
Every topic we'll cover, week by week.
{{< /imgcard >}}  

Multiprogramming vs multiprocessing, caches, cores, threads.

**You'll be better at buying computer hardware for performance when we're done.**

## Attendance
I expect everyone to attend every class.

If you work, it's time to talk to your boss about getting 3 hours off to make the most of your cash investment!

### All 3 Assessments

## Assessment 1: Programming labs

I'll refer to assessments as A1, A2 for brevity, or by their content: labs, multi threaded app, gpu app. 

A1 is a series of programming labs, done partly in class and at home:

## High performance computing

Hpc
Recent history.

## Activity 2 Homework: reading and exercises

Yes, textbooks! Yes, homework!

- Book link
- Exercises and exact reading bits
- Duck them at your own hazard. If, in the final days before an assessment deadine, you ask for help on anything covered in the homework, expect to receive a link.

### Submission

Email to me by **12pm, day _before_ class,** not day _of_ class.
