The most important part of the modeling process is the plan you have going in, and the reference you're counting on.

## REVIEW SUBMISSIONS

Feedback to action
Demonstrating simple drawing. Grid?
Screenshot maya and draw on that.
More images of kits to learn from.

## Modeling more bits

We covered this last week. People just need to get started.
I'll model some bits that aren't just a wall and floor.
Short one this week with a catchup later in week where people need to have made progress. Feedback and live fixes/help session.

## Due this week

Models for all your bits.
Snap together some instances. To make areas. Focus on getting it done, not on detail.
These are WORKING models, not pure art: they have to do a job first. Make sure you check often that they succeed.

## Next week (7)
Checking, feedback.
How to unwrap uvs.
