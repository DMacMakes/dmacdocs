**Week 4 Deliverables**  

Final images and Maya project **11:55pm Sunday Jun 28, end of Week 4.**

### Week 2 submission details

You need to have **blocked out your model** in sufficient detail to communicate the concept well through the silhouette:no fine detail yet, but it should communicate the object type, its proportions, and whether it's dynamic or very rigid, hand or machine made, realistic or cartoony, focussed on charm or accuracy.

1. Capture **3-4 images** of your blocked out model. 
    * Screenshot them from the Maya viewport. They can be JPG or PNG
    * Choose a few angles/views that show the qualities of the model well. A 3/4 shot looking down on the model (like in the concepts) is always a good idea.
    * Enable _wireframe on shaded_ and _ambient occlusion_ in the viewport.
    * Don't submit tiny images, zoom in so your model takes up a lot of screenspace.  

2. **By Wednesday 6pm, reply to** [this post on the discussion forums](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/discussionboard/do/message?action=list_messages&course_id=_91934_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&tab_id=&conf_id=_157930_1&forum_id=_851211_1&message_id=_2089254_1). 
    * Insert your **screenshots** into the post (not as attachments, as embedded images so we can see them)
    * Paste in a screenshot of **pureref** showing any 3D style reference you looked up.
    * In your reply, **answer these questions**. _Think about your answers carefully: half-efforts or copied answers will hurt your marks._  
      1. Describe the elements of style that you saw in the model, and sought to capture in 3D (100 words).  
      2. What were your main challenges in and blocking your chosen prop? What characteristics did you think you captured, and was there anything you weren't satisfied with? (100 words)  

3. **By Thursday 12pm (midday) comment on your classmates work:**
    * Add a **comment** on posts by **2 of your classmates**, answering:
      1. How effective do you think the student translating the concept into a 3d base mesh? (50 words)
      2. What improvements could the student make to enhance the blocked prop that was created, before moving on to detailing? (50 words)
